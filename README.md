# Graph-structure-data-analysis-app-Java-

To better facilitate users to interact with graph data structure, I created a program using a variety of data types and 20+ custom and built-in methods. This GUI allows users to manipulate data nodes and edges with mouse actions and execute sorting algorithms. Although this project took me unexpected long time (9 days) to complete, I enjoyed figuring out technical problems and persisted to the end. This project gave me a sense of what real-world projects could be.
